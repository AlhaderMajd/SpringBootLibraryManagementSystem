ðŸ“š Project Overview: Library Management System
This project involves developing a Library Management System using Spring Boot, MySQL, and JPA. The system manages users and books with role-based access control, supporting three roles: ADMIN, AUTHOR, and MEMBER. Each user has a unique user_id (auto-generated), a name, and a securely hashed password.â€‹

User roles are managed through a separate Role entity, which associates a single role to each user via the user_id. The Book entity includes a book_id, an author_id linking to the User entity, and a book_name.â€‹

Role-Based Access:

ADMIN: Can perform all operations except adding new books.

AUTHOR: Can perform all CRUD operations on their own books and view books by others.

MEMBER: Can only view all books.â€‹

When an ADMIN deletes an AUTHOR, all books associated with that AUTHOR are also deleted, maintaining referential integrity.â€‹

Technical Specifications:

Database: MySQL with tables generated automatically through JPA annotations.

Password Security: Passwords are stored using secure hashing.

Default Admin: A default ADMIN user is inserted into the database upon application startup.

Project Structure: Organized into the following packages:

entity: Data models.

dao: Data access objects.

service: Business logic.

rest: RESTful controllers.

security: Authentication and authorization mechanisms.
